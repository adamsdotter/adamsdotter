			<h1>Home of Patricia Adamsson</h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to the home of web developer Patricia Adamsson, a.k.a Mjau. The graphical things on this website, are things that in some way represent me. :)
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm a freelancing Frontend Developer at my own company <a href="http://www.dev-cat.com">DevCat</a>.
				Stockholm is my home town but I live in Berlin since a few years back. I'm open for projects both in Stockholm and Berlin, or partly/fully remotely.

				Please feel free to <a href="/contact/">contact me</a> if you've got any questions.

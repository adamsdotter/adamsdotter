				<h1>About <span>Patricia Adamsson</span></h1>
				<div>
					<p>
						My name is Patricia. I am a Frontend Developer.
						Creating websites has been my biggest interest since the age of 13. In 1999 I built my first website using cool frames, table layouts,
						java applets and the amazing <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tags. Since then I've been loving to build websites.
					</p>
					<p>
						I've been working in the web industry since 2008, and have since then been loving every day at work - because I get to <i>work</i> with my hobby! &lt;3
					</p>
					<p>
						On my spare time, you'll find me in front of my computer, probably coding on one of my many side projects.
						When not coding I love to travel, and try to do it as often as I possibly can.
